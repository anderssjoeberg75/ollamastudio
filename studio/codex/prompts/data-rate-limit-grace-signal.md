@internal Usage-limit grace signal. Follows the latest served main-loop or subagent response: set when it reports grace-zone utilization > 0 (the server reports that only to a request that sent `anthropic-usage-limit: extended`, tengu_lantern_spool), cleared when a response the limiter ran on reports none or, if the latest in-zone response named the grace window's reset, once that reset passes on this machine's clock. Side calls, and responses with no `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-status` (the limiter did not run), are not read. A refused request's 429 is not read either, so while requests are refused the last value persists: still expire any UI derived from this field via resetsAt. While set, overageStatus allowed / allowed_warning means paid extra usage covers the overflow (nothing will be cut off). Stays true at hard exhaustion (status rejected); combine with status instead of reading this field alone as "still usable".
